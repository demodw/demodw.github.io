I'm a **Senior Researcher** and **Head of the Data Science group** at University Hospital Hvidovre's Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, with a focus on women's health, reproduction, and pregnancy. I also serve as an **Associate Professor** at the Technical University of Denmark's Department of Health Technology and am co-founder of two healthtech startups where I function as **CTO** and **CDO**.

My research leverages Bayesian statistics, machine learning, and text mining alongside multi-omics data analysis (genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, metagenomics) to decode complex biological mechanisms behind pregnancy complications and their connection to broader health outcomes. Our team's mission is to transform research findings into clinical decision-making tools that meaningfully improve women's healthcare.


## Research
My early research focused on sex differences in disease, which garnered significant attention from media outlets such as Reuters, Der Spiegel, and Forbes ([Nature Communications, 2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-08475-9)). I then expanded my work to investigate the long-term consequences of recurrent pregnancy loss on maternal health, demonstrating profound cardiovascular and autoimmune effects even a decade later ([Journal of the American Heart Association, 2020](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/JAHA.119.015069)). Additionally, as an advocate for open science, I have explored the impact of limited access to full-text articles on research ([PLOS Computational Biology, 2018](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005962)).

As a [BRIDGE Translational Postdoctoral Fellow](https://bridge.ku.dk/), I immersed myself in the clinical setting to better understand patient needs. This experience led to four impactful publications demonstrating:

* The role of progesterone signaling in postpartum hemorrhage, the leading cause of maternal morbidity ([Nature Genetics 2024](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-024-01839-y)).
* The profound impact of previous pregnancies on the immune system in later pregnancies ([BMC Medicine 2024](https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-024-03797-y)).
* The poor predictive performance of fertility history for subsequent pregnancies (featured in Science News) ([Human Reproduction, 2021](https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article/36/4/1065/6062281)).
* The association between RPL and reduced family size ([Acta Obstetricia et Gynecologica Scandinavica 2021](https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/aogs.14265)).

In my current role as Head of Data Science, I drive research and innovation, for instance characterizing [sperm parameters in recurrent pregnancy loss](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1472648323008726) and [maternal risk factors for recurrent pregnancy loss](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165037824001062). My work has resulted in four pending patent applications related to novel diagnostics in the realm of pregnancy loss.
