collection: publications
excerpt: '
<u>Key findings</u>

* <b>Novel Approach for Large-Scale Analysis</b>: The study developed a new method to estimate heritability and genetic correlations that can efficiently handle massive datasets, opening doors for future population-wide genetic studies.

* <b>Sex-Specific Genetic Landscape</b>: We uncovered significant differences in heritability between men and women for numerous diseases, highlighting the importance of considering sex in genetic research and treatment.

* <b>Sex-Specific Genetic Landscape</b>: We uncovered significant differences in heritability between men and women for numerous diseases, highlighting the importance of considering sex in genetic research and treatment.

* <b>Unveiling Disease Connections</b>: By examining genetic correlations, we identified unexpected links between seemingly unrelated diseases, potentially revealing shared biological mechanisms and new avenues for diagnosis and treatment.

* <b>Heritability of Disease Trajectories<b/>: We investigated the heritability of disease trajectories, examining how genetic factors influence the progression and development of multiple diseases over time. This is a novel approach that could provide insights into the complex interplay between genetics and disease progression.
