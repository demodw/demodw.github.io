<u>Key findings</u>

* <b>Preexisting Conditions and Biomarkers</b>: Inflammatory markers are linked to preexisting conditions like maternal age, pre-pregnancy BMI, chronic diseases, prior pregnancy complications, and COVID-19 exposure. Smoking during pregnancy significantly affects multiple biomarkers.

* <b>Biomarkers and Obstetric Complications</b>: Specific biomarkers are associated with various obstetric complications. For example, IL-6 is inversely correlated with pre-eclampsia risk, while GDM is linked to IL-1RA, IL-17D, and Eotaxin-3. Severe PPH is associated with CRP and proteins of the IL-17 family.

* <b>Predictive Modeling</b>: Machine learning models using these biomarkers show promise in predicting GDM and pre-eclampsia, with IL-1RA and Eotaxin-3 being significant for GDM, and MIP-1Î², IL-1RA, and IL-12p70 for pre-eclampsia.
