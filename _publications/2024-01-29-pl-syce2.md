title: "Variant in the synaptonemal complex protein SYCE2 associates with pregnancy loss through effect on recombination"
collection: publications
excerpt: '
<u>Key findings</u>

* <b>SYCE2 Variant and Pregnancy Loss</b>: A specific genetic variant (rs189296436-A) in the SYCE2 gene is associated with an increased risk of pregnancy loss. This variant is found in a protein essential for the proper alignment and recombination of chromosomes during meiosis (the process of cell division that creates eggs and sperm).

* <b>Impact on Recombination</b>: The SYCE2 variant affects the placement and frequency of crossovers (the exchange of genetic material between chromosomes during meiosis). It leads to crossovers occurring closer to the ends of chromosomes (telomeres) and alters the recombination rate, particularly in longer chromosomes.

* <b>Potential Mechanism</b>: These changes in recombination patterns may increase the risk of chromosomal abnormalities, which are a major cause of pregnancy loss. The effect on recombination may be more pronounced in pregnancies that do not result in live births, suggesting that it contributes to early pregnancy loss.
