excerpt: '
<u>Key findings</u>

* <b>Prevalence of Risk Factors</b>: The most common risk factors identified in RPL patients were uterine anomalies (10%), irregular menstrual periods (7.9%), and parental chromosomal abnormalities (6.4%).

* <b>Impact on Live Birth Rate</b>: Maternal age, the number of prior pregnancy losses, antiphospholipid syndrome (APAS), and uterine malformations were associated with a reduced live birth rate.

* <b>Treatment of APS</b>: Treatment of APAS with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) significantly improved the live birth rate in patients confirmed to have APAS.
