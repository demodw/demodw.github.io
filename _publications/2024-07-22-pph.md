title: "Genome-wide association meta-analysis identifies five loci associated with postpartum hemorrhage"
collection: publications
excerpt: '
<u>Key findings</u>

* <b>Genetic Links to Postpartum Hemorrhage</b>: The study identified five genetic locations (loci) linked to postpartum hemorrhage (PPH), the leading cause of maternal death. This suggests a genetic component to PPH susceptibility.

* <b>Role of Progesterone Signaling</b>: The genes at three of these loci (<i>HAND2, TBX3, and RAP2C/FRMD7</i>) are all regulated by progesterone, a hormone crucial for pregnancy. This implicates dysregulation of progesterone signaling in the development of PPH.

* <b>Genetic Correlations</b>: Strong genetic correlations were found between PPH and birth weight, gestational duration, and uterine fibroids, suggesting shared genetic influences on these conditions.

* <b>Early Bleeding Complexity</b>: Bleeding in early pregnancy did not show strong associations with specific genetic variants, suggesting a complex, potentially polygenic origin for this condition.

* <b>Distinct Genetic Pathways</b>: The genetic factors influencing early bleeding appear to be different from those influencing PPH, suggesting distinct underlying mechanisms for these two types of pregnancy complications.
